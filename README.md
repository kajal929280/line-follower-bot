A Line Follower Robot is an autonomous robot that follows a pre-defined path, usually a black line on a white surface or vice versa. It uses IR sensors to detect the line and an L298N motor driver to control the motors. The microcontroller (Arduino in this case) processes the sensor data and adjusts the robot's movement accordingly.
